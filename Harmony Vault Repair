### Summary      

 Harmony Vault Repair .

### Abstract

The Chainlink Oracle on the Mai vault on Harmony needs to be changed to support the Band Oracle price feed. As of now the vaults do not function at all due to Chainlink cutting all price feeds, which has resulted in the users funds being locked inside. A simple switching of the oracle would solve this problem and allow users to get access to their funds.



### Motivation

This repair is simple and can be carried out without great time or cost.

### Specification

### Rationale

 The chainlink oracle is no longer used by harmony, they have now partnered with Band for all price feeds, due to this change the MAI vualts are unable to be repaid and the user funds are locked inside and the vaults are not visible in the application. By updating the oracle this problem would be resolved and the vaults on Harmony would be working properly.

### Technical Specification

Band Oracle addresses can be seen below:
